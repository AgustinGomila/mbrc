MusicBee Remote - for Android
-----------------------------

MusicBee Remote is a remote control application for [MusicBee](http://getmusicbee.com/). It is available on 
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kelsos.mbrc)

To function it requires a [plugin](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc-plugin) dll that acts as a server to enable communication with MusicBee. 

You can find more info on the related [website](http://kelsos.net/musicbeeremote/).


The android application is going to be part of my thesis.
