MusicBee Remote - for Android
-----------------------------

Â© 2013 Konstantinos Paparas

MusicBee Remote is a remote control application for [MusicBee](http://getmusicbee.com/). It is available on 
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kelsos.mbrc)

It is an open-source application under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) and it is part of my thesis.

To function it also requires a plugin for MusicBee I am working on that will be also released in the near future under GPLv3.
